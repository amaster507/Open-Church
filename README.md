Open Church
=================================

This is a start from an idea for a Web based application for churches to use to manage membership, campaigns, bus rosters, bulletins, calendars, attendance records, etc.

Please look throught the issues for suggested data flows in the planning process. Feel free to create new data flows. I will soon create comments on these issues to show their relation to the database and how actual data will be collected and saved so be sure to watch this repository and come back regularly for updates.

Please look through the Wiki pages for tables that we are considering adding for the development stage of the project.

This project is currently in the Idea gathering stage. So please be sure to add lots of input!

Languages/Extensions that will be utilized in this application include but not limited to: PHP, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, FPDF

If you would like to be added or removed as a Collaborator on this projuct please let me know.

# UPDATE:

This project is being sidelined for the upcoming release of MissionBase which will soon evolve into a Church Management System.
